%\boldmath
Non-Intrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM) is the process of disaggregating the overall electricity usage into constituent appliances. In this paper we extend the Combinatorial Optimization (CO) approach for disaggregation, which was originally proposed in the seminal work on NIALM, in following two ways: 1) Breaking the problem into subproblems and reducing the state space; 2) Applying additional constraints backed by sound domain expertise. We evaluate our approach using REDD dataset and show practical problems which need to be solved while dealing with the dataset. We also propose a metric for evaluating NILM, which we believe overcomes many shortcomings of commonly used metrics.

\section{NIALM}
Discuss in brief the NIALM problem
\subsection{Terminologies/ Notations}
Borrow the notation used by Parson and Hart.
\begin{itemize}
\item Input: Aggregate power sequence: $x=\{ x_1,..,x_T\}$
\item Infer: Power draw by constituent appliance: $y_n=\{y_{1,n},..y_{T,n}\}$
\item Time slice: $t\in {1,..T}$
\item Appliance: $n\in{1,..N}$
\item Appliance state: $z_n=\{z_1,..z_T\}$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{NIALM using combinatorial optimization}
This approach resembles subset sum problem and tries to minimize the difference of total observed power from the sum of various possible subsets coming from various combinations of appliances in different states. For each appliance we assume \textbf{K} states and at a given time, an appliance can only be in a single state. This is given as: 
$z_{t,n,k}\in\{0,1\} $ and, $$\sum\limits_{k=1}^{k=K} z_{t,n,k}=1$$The power drawn by each appliance is given by:
$$\mu_n=\{\mu_{n,1},..\mu_{n.K}\}$$ Thus, CO can be formulated as:
$$z_t=arg min_{z_t}|x_t-\sum\limits_{n=1}^{N}\sum\limits_{k=1}^{K}z_{t,n,k}\mu_{n,k}|$$

\begin{itemize}
\item Statespace is $K^N$
\item We assign different loads to different mains, $N_i$ loads to $Mains_i$, $\sum\limits_{1}^{p}{N_i}=N$. Now different state spaces are
$K^{N_1}$.... We can define the overall state space as $\max{K^{N_i}}$

As a practical example, two mains, 20 appliance, state space before = $2^{20}$. After = $2^{10}$. Exponential reduction in state space.
\end{itemize}

Highlight what is the simplification you are bringing forth.

\section{Name of algorithm as section label}
Think of appropriate name for your approach
\textbf{Flowchart- TO go as image/flow diagram}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Data Preprocessing
\begin{enumerate}
\item Aligning Mains and Appliance Level data
\item Down sampling to 1 minute resolution
\end{enumerate}
\item Load Assignment based on 
\begin{enumerate}

\item Appliance usage times
\item Appliance Periodicity
\item Appliance Power threshold
\item Correlation amongst different appliance usage

\end{enumerate}
\item Data Recalibration using the following
\begin{enumerate}
\item Step changes occurring in Mains vs Appliances
\item Isolating single appliance usage
\end{enumerate}
\item Appliance states identification using clustering (Possibly talk about unbalanced data, but leave it for future work)
\item State space creation
\item Applying CO for different mains
\item Find energy distribution by appliance and assign weights (To be used in results)

\end{enumerate}


Explanation of above steps
\subsection{Data Pre processing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Aligned data
\item Down sampling and why it is needed
\begin{itemize}
\item Sub metered data collected sometimes at 3s sometimes at 4 s
\item Getting rid of transients, also suggested by Hart
\item Reducing power fluctuations occurring due to voltage fluctuations. Put figure showing reduction in transients and signal smoothing
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Load assignment}
Draws inspiration from work by Parson et. al \cite{parson2012_aaai}. From prior knowledge we divide the loads into two different categories: Periodic such as refrigerator and non periodic such as Television.

\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{About Dataset}
\begin{itemize}
\item 6 home data, summer of 2011, Boston
\item ~14 days per home
\item Submetered information made available
\item High Freq., Low frequency data, we chose low freq data for our analysis
\item 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation Metric}
\begin{itemize}
\item Image of confusion matrix
\item Show confusion matrix and argue that accuracy can be misleading, state 0 dominates in all appliances and will most probably always be predicted correctly
\item Hart pointed towards residual power as an evaluation metric, REDD paper talks about \% of energy recovered
\item METRIC 1: Given an appliance having $m$ states, we propose power weighted appliance accuracy, as follows
$Appliance Accuracy = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} Accuracy(i)*Power(i)}{Power(i)} $
\item METRIC 2: In this we also take into consideration the amount of time an appliance is in a particular state
\item Overall Accuracy : Based on energy weights of different appliance, for instance .4* Fridge +.2*Light+...
This is important since it shows the relative importance of larger loads 
\item Switch continuity
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Empirical Analysis}

\begin{itemize}
\item Table on Cluster assignment
\item Table on Results
\item Table on on /off periods
\item Table on switch continuity
\end{itemize}



\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion goes here.

\section{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item Applying model on noisy datasets
\item 2 D CO (when Real and Reactive Power are known)
\item Factoring in Time of Day etc.
\item Factoring in Appliance Correlation
\item Factor in switch continuity, essentially leads to Factorial HMM
\end{itemize}
